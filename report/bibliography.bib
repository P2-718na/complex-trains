Illustrated throughout in full colour, this pioneering textbook, spanning a wide range of topics from physics to computer science, engineering, economics and the social sciences, introduces network science to an interdisciplinary audience. From the origins of the six degrees of separation to explaining why networks are robust to random failures, the author explores how viruses like Ebola and H1N1 spread, and why it is that our friends have more friends than we do. Using numerous real-world examples, this innovatively designed text includes clear delineation between undergraduate and graduate level material"},

This unregulated growth leads to a huge and complex web, which becomes a large directed graph whose vertices are documents and whose edges are links (URLs) that point from one document to another. The topology of this graph determines the web's connectivity and consequently how effectively we can locate information on it. But its enormous size (estimated to be at least 8108 documents1) and the continual changing of documents and links make it impossible to catalogue all the vertices and edges."},

These power-laws hold for three snapshots of the Internet, between November 1997 and December 1998, despite a 45\% growth of its size during that period. We show that our power-laws fit the real data very well resulting in correlation coefficients of 96\% or higher.Our observations provide a novel perspective of the structure of the Internet. The power-laws describe concisely skewed distributions of graph properties such as the node outdegree. In addition, these power-laws can be used to estimate important parameters such as the average neighborhood size, and facilitate the design and the performance analysis of protocols. Furthermore, we can use them to generate and select realistic topologies for simulation purposes.},

  abstract = {We consider a random graph process in which vertices are added to the graph one at a time and joined to a fixed number m of earlier vertices, where each earlier vertex is chosen with probability proportional to its degree. This process was introduced by Barabási and Albert [3], as a simple model of the growth of real-world graphs such as the world-wide web. Computer experiments presented by Barabási, Albert and Jeong [1,5] and heuristic arguments given by Newman, Strogatz and Watts [23] suggest that after n steps the resulting graph should have diameter approximately log n. We show that while this holds for m=1, for m=2 the diameter is asymptotically log n/log log n.

abstract = {Railway transportation is one of the most popular and greenest transportation modes for passengers. Its importance has increased in some regions owing to the deployment of high-speed infrastructures. In Europe, it is a competitive transportation mode for short and medium distance journeys, rivalling airway mode. For topological analysis of transportation networks, Complex Networks Analysis (CNA) appears as a powerful methodology that although used in various circumstances to describe national railway networks, it has not been used thus far at a continental level. In this paper, two topological characterisations of the European International Railway Network are performed using CNA. The first analyses the direct connection among cities in the international railway service using the most commonly used metrics. The results are compared with those of the Chinese Railway Network, of similar size, observing their differences regarding assortativity. The second analysis incorporates passenger transfers between services, discussing how connectivity is improved when timetables are synchronised, remarking the importance of such coordination. Centrality metrics are defined for the assessment of the connectivity of the network. For the sake of realism, thresholds for the maximum reasonable distance to be travelled by train are introduced in the definition of the centrality metrics.}

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

@article{communityDetection,
  abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},
