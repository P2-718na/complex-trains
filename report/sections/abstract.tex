In this work I investigate the robustness of the European train network, modeled using passenger route data from the Trainline online platform. Degree distribution analysis reveals a scale-free topology characterized by a degree distribution exponent of $\gamma = 2.23$, placing the network within the ultra-small world regime. This configuration supports high resilience to random failures, with connectivity preserved even when up to $95\%$ of nodes are removed. However, the scale-free nature of the network also indicates vulnerability to targeted attacks: simulations show that removing just $20\%$ of the highest-degree nodes can
lead to network fragmentation. 
Community detection reveals the existence of four major communities which are locally more robust to targeted attacks and contribute to delay the effective destruction of the network. These findings highlight critical strengths and weaknesses within the European train network and suggest that more insight could be obtained by performing further studies.
